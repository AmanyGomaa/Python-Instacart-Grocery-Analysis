# Objective
Instacart, an online grocery store
that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they
want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Your task is to
perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order
to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on
the provided criteria.
# Key Questions
● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the
day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at
times when there are fewer orders.

● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people
spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
these times.

● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to
use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
product orders.
# dataset
the dataset is an open-source data sets from Instacart. there is also a customer data set (created and included for the purpose of
this project), While each data set contains a different kind of information, they all include some
kind of common identifier.
# folders
Description of folder contents are as follows:

● 01 Project Management: Contains the project brief and related documentation.

● 02 Data: Includes two subfolders: (Data not uploaded to GitHub due to size limitations.)
'Original Data': Original datasets.
'Prepared Data': Cleaned data ready for analysis.

● 03 Scripts: Python code for the analysis, executed using Jupyter notebooks.

● 04 Analysis: Contains the 'Visualizations' subfolder with all visualizations used for exploratory analysis and explaining insights.

● 05 Sent to Client: Final Excel presentation.
